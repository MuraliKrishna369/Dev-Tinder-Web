- Install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
- configure store => provide the store to app => create slice => export reducer and actions
- when user login successful navigate to feed page, and update the navabar image
- if the user is login sucessful then only navigate to feed page
- fix the problem => the user is wiped out when i refresh the page
- why? => is beacuse our redux store refreshed
- we are no more in login page to make again api call!
- So use profile/view api and get the user and store it again in redux
- whick component should make that make call
- Body compoent is best . beacause body is the parent
